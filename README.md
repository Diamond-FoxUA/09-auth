📌 About the Project

NoteHub is a solo learning project focused on mastering the core concepts of Next.js App Router, routing architecture, and authentication flow.

The project emphasizes routing logic, middleware, cookies-based sessions, metadata configuration, and access control rather than UI design (styles were provided as part of the assignment).

A learning backend API is used to handle authentication and notes data.
